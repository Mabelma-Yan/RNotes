## Tapply

Tapply can apply a function to each cell of a ragged array, that is to each (non-empty) group of values given by a unique combination of the levels of certain factors. It can achieve a similar output just like **group_by**

```{r example}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)

##Assume I need to know the average mpg by cyl numbers
## group_by would be:
avg1 <- mtcars%>%
  group_by(cyl)%>%
  summarize(avg = mean(mpg))
avg1
```
```{r example, cont}
##tapply wpuld be:
avg2 <- tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean)
avg2
```
```{r example 3}
##Sapply with split can also achieve the same output:
avg3 <- sapply(split(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl), mean)
avg3
```
